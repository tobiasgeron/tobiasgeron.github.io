                     I have taught an undergraduate course titled "Introduction to Stars and Galaxies" twice: first as co-instructor in the Summer of 2024, and then as the sole head instructor in the Summer of 2025. This course, aimed at non-science majors, had 196 students enrolled in the most recent iteration. I found it deeply rewarding to share my enthusiasm for astronomy with students and am committed to supporting an engaging and supportive learning environment. Topics that we discussed include, but are not limited to: special relativity, general relativity, the twin paradox, black holes, neutron stars, the Sun, the life cycle of stars, the Milky Way, galaxy morphology, dark matter, Hubble's Law, the expansion of the Universe, dark energy, and the Big Bang. This course also included a few telescope nights, see picture on the left below.  My overall score on the course evaluations was notably higher than the divisional average (4.7/5 vs 4.2/5), and I scored equal to or above the divisional average on all criteria. The figure on the right shows the results from the evaluations for a few selected criteria. Full course evaluations are available upon request.

                     I also received a lot of positive feedback from students. A few examples from the anonymous 2025 course evaluations include:

                     <ul style="text-align:left;">
                        <li>The prof is passionate about what he is teaching. This is good, his enthusiasm is appreciated.</li>

                        <li>The prof was clear, easy to follow, humorous, and very insightful! His slides are great and I can't believe this is only his second year teaching the course. It was great!</li>

                        <li>It was beyond perfect. My interaction with course materials during and after lectures was enjoyable and rich.</li>

                        <li>Instructor was great! In class the slides were simple and comprehensive, explained well, and easy to notate. The instruction was conducted with enthusiasm and the environment was fun and productive.</li>
                        
                        <li>The overall quality of instruction for this course was great and made this course so much more enjoyable.</li>

                        <li>Professor Géron was a fantastic instructor. His teaching style featured many participatory assignments which really helped at ensuring we were learning the material and were also good for keeping attention. The mix of videos, diagrams, and pictures that also helped explain concepts we were learning in class and were very interesting as well. He was also very approachable and created a positive atmosphere for asking questions or further clarification on a topic or just talking during the break. He explained course concepts extremely clearly and made it as straightforward as can be to follow. You can also clearly tell that he is passionate about the topic which is reflected in the instruction of the course. I really enjoyed this class. Thank you Professor Géron for a great semester!</li>

                        <li>I was also kept engaged with the lectures and materials. I felt that the assignments were very helpful for fully understanding the material and for studying. Even though the summer course is quite fast, I felt I gained a deep understanding of the topics and didn't feel overwhelmed by the information presented.</li>

                        <li>Professor Géron made the content exciting to learn about. He was evidently passionate about teaching us, and was very patient with students who had questions. It was excellent.</li>

                        <li>The instructor is friendly and kind, I think this experience was really nice.</li>

                        <li>Professor Géron was very friendly and engaging. Each lecture was very interesting, and the pace of the course was perfect for an introduction to astronomy.</li>

                        <li>Prof. Géron was enthusiastic, patient, detailed, and overall a wonderful instructor. He clearly enjoyed fielding questions that students asked out of interest, even when they were outside the scope of the course. His use of in-class questions really helped me to test myself continuously through the class, and I found them very helpful. He was always available to answer questions after class, and his enthusiasm during class and during the telescope nights was infectious. I hope I am able to take another class from him again!</li>

                        <li>I really appreciated the prof, I think he did a great job at explaining concepts and being approachable to students and making the material accessible despite its complexity. The class was engaging and stimulating and eye-opening and inspiring overall.</li>

                        <li>I think the quality of the instruction in this course was very good. The prof often mixed in external videos, etc., with the lectures for visuals which was engaging, and although the lectures consisted of 70-140 slides each, they were broken down very well and were simple to digest. The prof also always managed to end the class on time, and even if a lecture had some parts leftover, they were covered the next day thoroughly.</li>

                        <li>Professor Géron knew the topics incredibly well, and was always genuine in his excitement to share them. I took the course to learn more about astronomy in a digestible manner. I'm normally not very good with straight memorization of names, and especially with math, but the course presented its information clearly and through an intuitive manner, so we never had to accept things at face value, nor need a bunch of equations to do them. Much of it was "here's how X works, and it feeds into Y" which I thought was excellent for the topic!</li>

                        <li>Appreciated Dr. Géron's willingness to answer any question and his patience to go back and explain subject matter for individual students. Also enjoyed the time he took to take us to telescope viewing nights and adding some fun to his approach to teaching.</li>

                        <li>I thought the prof was really generous with answering questions and never rushed students which is great.</li>

                        <li>Tobias Géron is a fantastic instructor who intellectually stimulates his students to understand scientific concepts through a qualitative lens. It must be challenging to deconstruct high-level astronomical phenomena without the use of mathematics, and Tobias Géron has done an incredible job of this.</li>

                        <li>Amazing course, fascinating subject matter! The sheer size of the universe, and the amount of galaxies and stars are just mindblowing! This was my second STEM course ever at UofT, which I'm taking as a breadth requirement, as I'm a philosophy student. I've hugely enjoyed it! Tobias is an excellent lecturer, very sensitive to the needs of his students and very keen to respond to in-class questions; he presents the material with enthusiasm and is very good at simplifying a lot of the complex information in astronomy and astrophysics. I also very much appreciate that, whenever students would ask him questions that he doesn't know the answer to, he would always come back with an answer at the start of the next class. The textbook can be a bit complex at times for some of us non-STEM people -- though I imagine the textbook market for astronomy textbooks is a little slim -- but the lectures and slides always have cleared all of that up! Thanks for the amazing experience in AST201!</li>

                        <li>The course was very engaging and the information taught was very easy to understand as someone who comes from a psychology background that doesn't deal with these topics.</li>

                        <li>Learning goals for each class were realistic and attainable. Professor showed great enthusiasm for teaching the course and was available/helpful during office hours. As a humanities student, the course was easy to follow and not overwhelming. I usually have a hard time keeping up with summer courses, however the speed of this course was perfect and the topics covered flowed super well (making it a lot easier to transition from topic to topic). I really enjoyed the opportunity of being able to participate in the extra activities - such as the telescope viewing event.</li>

                        <li>The quality was great. The concepts, even though highly abstract, were explained in terms analogous to everyday life. This was very helpful.</li>

                        <li>Professor was enthusiastic, approachable, helpful during classes and after class. Our questions were always addressed with thoughtful explanations.</li>

                     </ul>
